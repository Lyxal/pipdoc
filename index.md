# Welcome to the Pip docs!

Pip is a concise and imperative golfing language.

This site contains the reference documentation for the Pip language. Note that there are two main versions of Pip: the current version from the Github repository, and [Pip Classic](pip-classic), the version available at [Try It Online!](https://tio.run/#pip) The documentation on this site represents the current version. Documentation of the Classic version is available [on Github](https://github.com/dloscutoff/pip/tree/2355d3c383c69b35539c44a640a7bdc5c2dbab14/Documentation).

For a tutorial-style introduction to Pip, visit the [Pip wiki](https://github.com/dloscutoff/pip/wiki). If you are looking to improve your Pip golfing skills, consult [the tips thread](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/210380/tips-for-golfing-in-pip). Feel free to contribute any tips of your own!
